            It all started 22 years ago in a city called Ceska Lipa. First couple of years of
            my life must have been all partying and no work, because I
            dont remember a thing. Then the first experience with school
            facility came, and oh boy, it was not fun.
          </p>
          <p>
            It soon became apparent that this is teachers first experience with
            recovering alcoholics and quite frankly that mental illness of hers
            didn't help as well. To this day I clearly remember as she took my
            sandwitch from under the table and throw it across the whole
            classroom. Guess there was shortage of teachers that year. This was
            Mrs. Travnickova first and last year of teaching, since no child
            has stayed in her classroom.
          </p>
          <p>
            This went on and on, bad experiences alternated good ones and
            nothing much else, until I hit puberty. I'm ashamed to admit it, but this
            was the time when I broke the promise of never touching a bottle
            again. And it was awesome. Life was fast, friends were everywhere,
            and popularity on the rise. Unfortunately that period of my life when I
            could be dependent on parents has slowly started to shrink and some
            basic responsibility had to be adopted. This leads us to now.

            Now I feel it is the right time to introduce myself. Hi my name is Kamil
            Polacek, owner of this website, former baby(as we already
            established) and so far the only contributor to this website. I'm
            currently studying information technology at CTU. The odd combination of
            personal traits is what I'm hoping to imprint into this website.
